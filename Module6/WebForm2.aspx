    coverage of the fundamentals of object-oriented programming. It includes an optional automated teller machine(ATM) case study that teaches the fundamentals
    of software engineering and object-oriented design with the UML. There are additional integrated case studies throughout the book including: the Time class, the
    Employee class and the GradeBook class. We provide discussion of more advanced topics such as XML, ASP.NET, ADO.NET and Web services as well as new topic coverage
